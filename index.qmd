# PORTFOLIO
This portfolio documents my learning journey in Public Policy Analytics (MUSA 5080).

## ABOUT THIS COURSE
Advanced spatial analysis and data science for urban planning and public policy.

## PORTFOLIO STRUCTURE
- **Weekly Notes:** Learning reflections and key concepts.
- **Labs:** Completed assignments and analyses.
- **Final Project:** Capstone modeling challenge.

## ABOUT ME
Analytically driven and adaptable with 2 years of research and 4 years of professional GIS experience primarily in vector data. Applied and academic knowledge in surveying project sites, remote sensing, drone navigation, and photogrammetry methods. Experience with Java, Python, and R for OOP, data science, geocomputation, spatial analysis, web-mapping, app development, and visualization.

As a result of my education and work history I have a deep interest in urban prototyping and instrumentation to record cities, deploying IoT sensors to collect real-time data for research in urban science, transportation, and environmental issues. Extending from that curiosity underlies a steadfast belief in everyone's rights to privacy and security in a world that constantly wants to monitor, police, and sell our data coercively and unconsensually—this fundamental foundation takes precedence to deploying any sensing device.

This course will allow me to refine my existing technical skillset and challenge me to apply them to urban and social predicaments that plague us—cities, municipalities, communities, the environment, *people*. What's important to me is that this class focuses on *not* becoming lost in the STEM aesthetics at the cost of humanitarian rights, educating future graduates about the damage that predictive analytics has wrought, especially in policing and how many tools wielded can disproportionately affect minoritized identities and peripheral communities.
