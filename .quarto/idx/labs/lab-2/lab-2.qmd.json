  2023 ACS data.\n\n-   How many tracts have missing income data?\n\n    -   65 tracts are missing income estimates and 73 tracts are missing\n        income MOEs.\n\n-   What is the median income across all PA census tracts?\n\n    -   \\$72,944.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Step 3: Define Vulnerable Populations\n\nIdentify census tracts with vulnerable populations based on TWO\ncriteria:\n\n1.  Low median household income (choose an appropriate threshold)\n\n2.  Significant elderly population (choose an appropriate threshold)\n\n**Your Task:**\n\n```{r}\n# Filter for vulnerable tracts based on your criteria\npa_tracts$pct_elderly <- (pa_tracts$age_65_overE / pa_tracts$total_popE) * 100\n\npa_tracts <- pa_tracts %>%\n  mutate(\n    low_income = case_when(median_incomeE <= 43700 ~ TRUE,\n                           median_incomeE > 43700 ~ FALSE),\n    high_elderly = case_when(pct_elderly >= 23.51 ~ TRUE,\n                             pct_elderly < 23.51 ~ FALSE),\n    vulnerable = case_when(low_income == TRUE | high_elderly == TRUE ~ TRUE,\n                           low_income == FALSE & high_elderly == FALSE ~ FALSE)\n  )\n\nvulnerable_summary <- pa_tracts %>%\n  group_by(vulnerable) %>%\n  summarize(\n    \"Number of Tracts\" = n(),\n    \"Median Income\" = median(median_incomeE, na.rm = TRUE),\n    \"Percent Elderly\" = median(pct_elderly, na.rm = TRUE),\n    \"Percent Vulnerable\" = (n() / 3445) * 100\n  )\n\nvulnerable_summary\n```\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n\n-   What income threshold did you choose and why?\n\n    -   \\$43,700 was the income threshold I chose based off of a [2023\n        paper published by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban\n        Development’s Office of Policy Development and\n        Research](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/home-datasets/files/HOME_IncomeLmts_State_PA_2023.pdf)\n        with a list of PA counties and low income estimates commensurate\n        with the area and number of individuals in a household. I took\n        the median of all the estimates for the different counties.\n\n-   What elderly population threshold did you choose and why?\n\n    -   I used 23.51% as the threshold because that's the third quartile\n        for the elderly population percentage in PA.\n\n-   How many tracts meet your vulnerability criteria?\n\n    -   1,152 tracts meet the vulnerability criteria.\n\n-   What percentage of PA census tracts are considered vulnerable by\n    your definition?\n\n    -   Approximately 33.44% of PA's census tracts are considered\n        vulnerable.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Step 4: Calculate Distance to Hospitals\n\nFor each vulnerable tract, calculate the distance to the nearest\nhospital.\n\n**Your Task:**\n\n```{r}\nvulnerable_tracts <- pa_tracts %>%\n  filter(vulnerable == TRUE)\n\n# Transform to appropriate projected CRS\nvulnerable_tracts <- st_transform(vulnerable_tracts, crs = 5070)\npa_tracts <- st_transform(pa_tracts, crs = 5070)\npa_hospitals <- st_transform(pa_hospitals, crs = 5070)\n\n# Calculate distance from each tract centroid to nearest hospital\nvulnerable_centroids <- st_centroid(vulnerable_tracts)\n\nnearest_hospital_index <- st_nearest_feature(vulnerable_centroids, pa_hospitals)\n\nnearest_hospital_point <- pa_hospitals[nearest_hospital_index,]\n\nhospital_distance <- st_distance(vulnerable_centroids, nearest_hospital_point, by_element = TRUE)\nvulnerable_tracts$nearest_hospital_mi <- set_units(hospital_distance, \"mi\")\n\nsummary(vulnerable_tracts)\n\nsum(vulnerable_tracts$nearest_hospital_mi > set_units(15, \"mi\"))\n```\n\n**Requirements:**\n\n-   Use an appropriate projected coordinate system for Pennsylvania\n\n-   Calculate distances in miles\n\n-   Explain why you chose your projection\n\n    -   I chose Albers Equal Area because it was appropriate when\n        calculating hospital distances all over the state, if I'd chosen\n        a PCS that was more localized like State Planes, then depending\n        whichever cardinal direction I selected, it'd have some\n        distortion in other regions of Pennsylvania.\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n\n-   What is the average distance to the nearest hospital for vulnerable\n    tracts?\n\n    -   4.35816 miles.\n\n-   What is the maximum distance?\n\n    -   28.98276 miles.\n\n-   How many vulnerable tracts are more than 15 miles from the nearest\n    hospital?\n\n    -   34 census tracts of the 1,152 total vulnerable tracts are more\n        than 15 miles from the nearest hospital.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Step 5: Identify Underserved Areas\n\nDefine \"underserved\" as vulnerable tracts that are more than 15 miles\nfrom the nearest hospital.\n\n**Your Task:**\n\n```{r}\n# Create underserved variable\nunderserved_tracts <- vulnerable_tracts %>%\n  filter(nearest_hospital_mi > set_units(15, \"mi\"))\n\nvulnerable_tracts <- vulnerable_tracts %>% mutate(\n  underserved = case_when(\n    vulnerable_tracts$nearest_hospital_mi > set_units(15, \"mi\") ~ TRUE,\n    TRUE ~ FALSE))\n\n(nrow(underserved_tracts) / nrow(vulnerable_tracts)) * 100\n\nglimpse(underserved_tracts)\nglimpse(vulnerable_tracts)\n```\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n\n-   How many tracts are underserved?\n\n    -   34 census tracts are underserved.\n\n-   What percentage of vulnerable tracts are underserved?\n\n    -   2.951389% of vulnerable census tracts are underserved.\n\n-   Does this surprise you? Why or why not?\n\n    -   Not quite. I'm from Utah and the disparity with hospital access\n        is expected, especially since it's twice the size of\n        Pennsylvania. I know in the US' East Coast I expect that the\n        states have better hospital coverage given that they were also\n        established as states over a century earlier than Utah, so\n        they've had that time to construct more expansive infrastructure\n        compared.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Step 6: Aggregate to County Level\n\nUse spatial joins and aggregation to calculate county-level statistics\nabout vulnerable populations and hospital access.\n\n**Your Task:**\n\n```{r}\n# Spatial join tracts to counties\nvulnerable_tracts <- vulnerable_tracts %>%\n  mutate(NAMELSADCO = str_remove_all(NAMELSADCO, \" County\"))\n\nvulnerable_tracts$NAMELSADCO <- toupper(vulnerable_tracts$NAMELSADCO)\n\nvulnerable_tracts <- st_transform(vulnerable_tracts, crs = 4326)\n\npa_counties <- st_transform(pa_counties, crs = 4326)\n\ncounty_tracts <- st_join(vulnerable_tracts, pa_counties, left = TRUE)\n\n# Aggregate statistics by county\naggregate_summary <- county_tracts %>%\n  st_drop_geometry() %>%\n  group_by(NAMELSADCO) %>%\n  summarize(\n    number_vulnerable = sum(vulnerable),\n    number_underserved = sum(underserved),\n    percent_underserved = (number_underserved / number_vulnerable) * 100,\n    avg_nearby_hospital_dist = mean(nearest_hospital_mi),\n    total_vulnerable_pop = sum(total_popE)\n  ) %>%\n  rename(\n    county = NAMELSADCO\n  )\n\npa_counties <- rename(pa_counties, county = COUNTY_NAM)\n\npa_mapping <- left_join(pa_counties, aggregate_summary, by = \"county\")\n\nggplot(pa_mapping) +\n  geom_sf(aes(fill = percent_underserved), color = \"white\", size = 0.5) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(\n    name = \"Percent Underserved\",\n    labels = comma,\n    option = \"magma\"\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Most Underserved Counties\",\n    subtitle = \"Pennsylvania\",\n    caption = \"Source: ACS 2019–2023\"\n  ) +\n  theme_void()\n```\n\n**Required county-level statistics:**\n\n-   Number of vulnerable tracts\n\n-   Number of underserved tracts\n\n-   Percentage of vulnerable tracts that are underserved\n\n-   Average distance to nearest hospital for vulnerable tracts\n\n-   Total vulnerable population\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n\n-   Which 5 counties have the highest percentage of underserved\n    vulnerable tracts?\n\n    -   Cameron (100%), Forest (100%), Sullivan (100%), Union (66.67%),\n        and Clearfield (61.54%) counties.\n\n-   Which counties have the most vulnerable people living far from\n    hospitals?\n\n    -   Counties with an average hospital distance of more than 15 miles\n        and with the most vulnerable people in that group are Sullivan,\n        Cameron, Forest, and Pike.\n\n-   Are there any patterns in where underserved counties are located?\n\n    -   It looks like more of the underserved counties are in the\n        northern portion of Pennsylvania, and seemingly clustered toward\n        the middle in addition. I also know those areas are peppered\n        with several forested regions like national and state forests.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Step 7: Create Summary Table\n\nCreate a professional table showing the top 10 priority counties for\nhealthcare investment.\n\n**Your Task:**\n\n```{r}\n# Create and format priority counties table\nkable_table <- pa_mapping[, c(\"county\", \"number_vulnerable\",\n                                \"number_underserved\", \"percent_underserved\",\n                                \"avg_nearby_hospital_dist\", \"total_vulnerable_pop\")]\n\nkable_table <- kable_table %>%\n  mutate(\n    avg_nearby_hospital_dist = drop_units(avg_nearby_hospital_dist)\n  )\n\nkable_table <- kable_table %>%\n  st_drop_geometry() %>%\n  rename(\n    \"County\" = county,\n    \"Number of Vulnerable Tracts\" = number_vulnerable,\n    \"Number of Underserved Tracts\" = number_underserved,\n    \"Percent Underserved\" = percent_underserved,\n    \"Average Mile(s) to Nearest Hospital\" = avg_nearby_hospital_dist,\n    \"Total Vulnerable People\" = total_vulnerable_pop\n  )\n\nkable_table <- kable_table %>%\n  arrange(desc(`Percent Underserved`)) %>%\n  slice(1:10)\n\nkable(\n  kable_table,\n  digit = 2,\n  format.args = list(big.mark = \",\"),\n  caption = \"<b>TOP 10 UNDERSERVED PENNSYLVANIA COUNTIES: For Priority Healthcare Investment</b>\"\n) %>%\n  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = \"striped\") %>%\n  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE) %>%\n  row_spec(0, color = \"mistyrose\", background = \"red3\")\n```\n\n**Requirements:**\n\n-   Use `knitr::kable()` or similar for formatting\n\n-   Include descriptive column names\n\n-   Format numbers appropriately (commas for population, percentages,\n    etc.)\n\n-   Add an informative caption\n\n-   Sort by priority (you decide the metric)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Part 2: Comprehensive Visualization\n\nUsing the skills from Week 3 (Data Visualization), create\npublication-quality maps and charts.\n\n### Map 1: County-Level Choropleth\n\nCreate a choropleth map showing healthcare access challenges at the\ncounty level.\n\n**Your Task:**\n\n```{r}\n# Create county-level access map\npa_hospitals <- st_transform(pa_hospitals, crs = 4326)\npa_mapping <-

counties by percentage of vulnerable tracts that are\n    underserved\n\n-   Include hospital locations as points\n\n-   Use an appropriate color scheme\n\n-   Include clear title, subtitle, and caption\n\n-   Use `theme_void()` or similar clean theme\n\n-   Add a legend with formatted labels\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Map 2: Detailed Vulnerability Map\n\nCreate a map highlighting underserved vulnerable tracts.\n\n**Your Task:**\n\n```{r}\n# Create detailed tract-level map\nvulnerable_tracts <- st_transform(vulnerable_tracts, crs =

underserved vulnerable tracts in a contrasting color\n\n-   Include county boundaries for context\n\n-   Show hospital locations\n\n-   Use appropriate visual hierarchy (what should stand out?)\n\n-   Include informative title and subtitle\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Chart: Distribution Analysis\n\nCreate a visualization showing the

distances\n\n-   Box plot comparing distances across regions\n\n-   Bar chart of underserved tracts by county\n\n-   Scatter plot of distance vs. vulnerable population size\n\n**Requirements:**\n\n-   Clear axes labels with units\n\n-   Appropriate title\n\n-   Professional formatting\n\n-   Brief interpretation (1-2 sentences as a caption or in text)\n\n    -   There's an upward regression line that seems to communicate and\n        positive correlation between distance to the nearest hospital\n        and the vulnerable population. However, a more in-depth\n        statistical analysis will be needed to determine any\n        significance, especially since the vast majority of points look\n        like they are varied from the regression line. The natural log\n        of the distance histogram was calculated due to the original\n        data being highly right-skewed.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Part 3: Bring Your Own Data Analysis\n\nChoose your own additional spatial dataset and conduct a supplementary\nanalysis.\n\n### Challenge Options\n\nChoose ONE of the following challenge exercises, or propose your own\nresearch question using OpenDataPhilly data\n(https://opendataphilly.org/datasets/).\n\n**Note these are just loose suggestions to spark ideas - follow or make\nyour own as the data permits and as your ideas evolve.

  2023 ACS data.\n\n-   How many tracts have missing income data?\n\n    -   65 tracts are missing income estimates and 73 tracts are missing\n        income MOEs.\n\n-   What is the median income across all PA census tracts?\n\n    -   \\$72,944.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Step 3: Define Vulnerable Populations\n\nIdentify census tracts with vulnerable populations based on TWO\ncriteria:\n\n1.  Low median household income (choose an appropriate threshold)\n\n2.  Significant elderly population (choose an appropriate threshold)\n\n**Your Task:**\n\n```{r}\n# Filter for vulnerable tracts based on your criteria\npa_tracts$pct_elderly <- (pa_tracts$age_65_overE / pa_tracts$total_popE) * 100\n\npa_tracts <- pa_tracts %>%\n  mutate(\n    low_income = case_when(median_incomeE <= 43700 ~ TRUE,\n                           median_incomeE > 43700 ~ FALSE),\n    high_elderly = case_when(pct_elderly >= 23.51 ~ TRUE,\n                             pct_elderly < 23.51 ~ FALSE),\n    vulnerable = case_when(low_income == TRUE | high_elderly == TRUE ~ TRUE,\n                           low_income == FALSE & high_elderly == FALSE ~ FALSE)\n  )\n\nvulnerable_summary <- pa_tracts %>%\n  group_by(vulnerable) %>%\n  summarize(\n    \"Number of Tracts\" = n(),\n    \"Median Income\" = median(median_incomeE, na.rm = TRUE),\n    \"Percent Elderly\" = median(pct_elderly, na.rm = TRUE),\n    \"Percent Vulnerable\" = (n() / 3445) * 100\n  )\n\nvulnerable_summary\n```\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n\n-   What income threshold did you choose and why?\n\n    -   \\$43,700 was the income threshold I chose based off of a [2023\n        paper published by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban\n        Development’s Office of Policy Development and\n        Research](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/home-datasets/files/HOME_IncomeLmts_State_PA_2023.pdf)\n        with a list of PA counties and low income estimates commensurate\n        with the area and number of individuals in a household. I took\n        the median of all the estimates for the different counties.\n\n-   What elderly population threshold did you choose and why?\n\n    -   I used 23.51% as the threshold because that's the third quartile\n        for the elderly population percentage in PA.\n\n-   How many tracts meet your vulnerability criteria?\n\n    -   1,152 tracts meet the vulnerability criteria.\n\n-   What percentage of PA census tracts are considered vulnerable by\n    your definition?\n\n    -   Approximately 33.44% of PA's census tracts are considered\n        vulnerable.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Step 4: Calculate Distance to Hospitals\n\nFor each vulnerable tract, calculate the distance to the nearest\nhospital.\n\n**Your Task:**\n\n```{r}\nvulnerable_tracts <- pa_tracts %>%\n  filter(vulnerable == TRUE)\n\n# Transform to appropriate projected CRS\nvulnerable_tracts <- st_transform(vulnerable_tracts, crs = 5070)\npa_tracts <- st_transform(pa_tracts, crs = 5070)\npa_hospitals <- st_transform(pa_hospitals, crs = 5070)\n\n# Calculate distance from each tract centroid to nearest hospital\nvulnerable_centroids <- st_centroid(vulnerable_tracts)\n\nnearest_hospital_index <- st_nearest_feature(vulnerable_centroids, pa_hospitals)\n\nnearest_hospital_point <- pa_hospitals[nearest_hospital_index,]\n\nhospital_distance <- st_distance(vulnerable_centroids, nearest_hospital_point, by_element = TRUE)\nvulnerable_tracts$nearest_hospital_mi <- set_units(hospital_distance, \"mi\")\n\nsummary(vulnerable_tracts)\n\nsum(vulnerable_tracts$nearest_hospital_mi > set_units(15, \"mi\"))\n```\n\n**Requirements:**\n\n-   Use an appropriate projected coordinate system for Pennsylvania\n\n-   Calculate distances in miles\n\n-   Explain why you chose your projection\n\n    -   I chose Albers Equal Area because it was appropriate when\n        calculating hospital distances all over the state, if I'd chosen\n        a PCS that was more localized like State Planes, then depending\n        whichever cardinal direction I selected, it'd have some\n        distortion in other regions of Pennsylvania.\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n\n-   What is the average distance to the nearest hospital for vulnerable\n    tracts?\n\n    -   4.35816 miles.\n\n-   What is the maximum distance?\n\n    -   28.98276 miles.\n\n-   How many vulnerable tracts are more than 15 miles from the nearest\n    hospital?\n\n    -   34 census tracts of the 1,152 total vulnerable tracts are more\n        than 15 miles from the nearest hospital.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Step 5: Identify Underserved Areas\n\nDefine \"underserved\" as vulnerable tracts that are more than 15 miles\nfrom the nearest hospital.\n\n**Your Task:**\n\n```{r}\n# Create underserved variable\nunderserved_tracts <- vulnerable_tracts %>%\n  filter(nearest_hospital_mi > set_units(15, \"mi\"))\n\nvulnerable_tracts <- vulnerable_tracts %>% mutate(\n  underserved = case_when(\n    vulnerable_tracts$nearest_hospital_mi > set_units(15, \"mi\") ~ TRUE,\n    TRUE ~ FALSE))\n\n(nrow(underserved_tracts) / nrow(vulnerable_tracts)) * 100\n\nglimpse(underserved_tracts)\nglimpse(vulnerable_tracts)\n```\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n\n-   How many tracts are underserved?\n\n    -   34 census tracts are underserved.\n\n-   What percentage of vulnerable tracts are underserved?\n\n    -   2.951389% of vulnerable census tracts are underserved.\n\n-   Does this surprise you? Why or why not?\n\n    -   Not quite. I'm from Utah and the disparity with hospital access\n        is expected, especially since it's twice the size of\n        Pennsylvania. I know in the US' East Coast I expect that the\n        states have better hospital coverage given that they were also\n        established as states over a century earlier than Utah, so\n        they've had that time to construct more expansive infrastructure\n        compared.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Step 6: Aggregate to County Level\n\nUse spatial joins and aggregation to calculate county-level statistics\nabout vulnerable populations and hospital access.\n\n**Your Task:**\n\n```{r}\n# Spatial join tracts to counties\nvulnerable_tracts <- vulnerable_tracts %>%\n  mutate(NAMELSADCO = str_remove_all(NAMELSADCO, \" County\"))\n\nvulnerable_tracts$NAMELSADCO <- toupper(vulnerable_tracts$NAMELSADCO)\n\nvulnerable_tracts <- st_transform(vulnerable_tracts, crs = 4326)\n\npa_counties <- st_transform(pa_counties, crs = 4326)\n\ncounty_tracts <- st_join(vulnerable_tracts, pa_counties, left = TRUE)\n\n# Aggregate statistics by county\naggregate_summary <- county_tracts %>%\n  st_drop_geometry() %>%\n  group_by(NAMELSADCO) %>%\n  summarize(\n    number_vulnerable = sum(vulnerable),\n    number_underserved = sum(underserved),\n    percent_underserved = (number_underserved / number_vulnerable) * 100,\n    avg_nearby_hospital_dist = mean(nearest_hospital_mi),\n    total_vulnerable_pop = sum(total_popE)\n  ) %>%\n  rename(\n    county = NAMELSADCO\n  )\n\npa_counties <- rename(pa_counties, county = COUNTY_NAM)\n\npa_mapping <- left_join(pa_counties, aggregate_summary, by = \"county\")\n\nggplot(pa_mapping) +\n  geom_sf(aes(fill = percent_underserved), color = \"white\", size = 0.5) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(\n    name = \"Percent Underserved\",\n    labels = comma,\n    option = \"magma\"\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Most Underserved Counties\",\n    subtitle = \"Pennsylvania\",\n    caption = \"Source: ACS 2019–2023\"\n  ) +\n  theme_void()\n```\n\n**Required county-level statistics:**\n\n-   Number of vulnerable tracts\n\n-   Number of underserved tracts\n\n-   Percentage of vulnerable tracts that are underserved\n\n-   Average distance to nearest hospital for vulnerable tracts\n\n-   Total vulnerable population\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n\n-   Which 5 counties have the highest percentage of underserved\n    vulnerable tracts?\n\n    -   Cameron (100%), Forest (100%), Sullivan (100%), Union (66.67%),\n        and Clearfield (61.54%) counties.\n\n-   Which counties have the most vulnerable people living far from\n    hospitals?\n\n    -   Counties with an average hospital distance of more than 15 miles\n        and with the most vulnerable people in that group are Sullivan,\n        Cameron, Forest, and Pike.\n\n-   Are there any patterns in where underserved counties are located?\n\n    -   It looks like more of the underserved counties are in the\n        northern portion of Pennsylvania, and seemingly clustered toward\n        the middle in addition. I also know those areas are peppered\n        with several forested regions like national and state forests.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Step 7: Create Summary Table\n\nCreate a professional table showing the top 10 priority counties for\nhealthcare investment.\n\n**Your Task:**\n\n```{r}\n# Create and format priority counties table\nkable_table <- pa_mapping[, c(\"county\", \"number_vulnerable\",\n                                \"number_underserved\", \"percent_underserved\",\n                                \"avg_nearby_hospital_dist\", \"total_vulnerable_pop\")]\n\nkable_table <- kable_table %>%\n  mutate(\n    avg_nearby_hospital_dist = drop_units(avg_nearby_hospital_dist)\n  )\n\nkable_table <-

 \"Percent Underserved\" = percent_underserved,\n    \"Average Mile(s) to Nearest Hospital\" = avg_nearby_hospital_dist,\n    \"Total Vulnerable People\" = total_vulnerable_pop\n  )\n\nkable_table <- kable_table %>%\n  arrange(desc(`Percent Underserved`)) %>%\n  slice(1:10)\n\nkable(\n  kable_table,\n  digit = 2,\n  format.args = list(big.mark = \",\"),\n  caption = \"<b>TOP 10 UNDERSERVED

background = \"red3\")\n```\n\n**Requirements:**\n\n-   Use `knitr::kable()` or similar for formatting\n\n-   Include descriptive column names\n\n-   Format numbers appropriately (commas for population, percentages,\n    etc.)\n\n-   Add an informative caption\n\n-   Sort by priority (you decide the metric)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n##

distances\n\n-   Box plot comparing distances across regions\n\n-   Bar chart of underserved tracts by county\n\n-   Scatter plot of distance vs. vulnerable population size\n\n**Requirements:**\n\n-   Clear axes labels with units\n\n-   Appropriate title\n\n-   Professional formatting\n\n-   Brief interpretation (1-2 sentences as a caption or in text)\n\n    -   There's an upward regression line that seems to communicate and\n        positive correlation between distance to the nearest hospital\n        and the vulnerable population. However, a more in-depth\n        statistical analysis will be needed to determine any\n        significance, especially since the vast majority of points look\n        like they are varied from the regression line. The natural log\n        of the distance histogram was calculated due to the original\n        data being highly right-skewed.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Part 3: Bring Your Own Data Analysis\n\nChoose your own additional spatial dataset and conduct a supplementary\nanalysis.\n\n### Challenge Options\n\nChoose ONE of the following challenge exercises, or propose your own\nresearch question using OpenDataPhilly data\n(https://opendataphilly.org/datasets/).\n\n**Note these are just loose suggestions to spark ideas - follow or make\nyour own as the data permits and as your ideas evolve.

datasets available as GeoJSON, Shapefile, or CSV with\n    coordinates\n\n-   Always check the Metadata for a data dictionary of the fields.\n\n**Additional Sources:**\n\n-   **Pennsylvania Open Data:** https://data.pa.gov/\n\n-   **Census Bureau (via tidycensus):** Demographics, economic\n    indicators, commute patterns\n\n-   **TIGER/Line (via tigris):** Geographic boundaries\n\n### Recommended Starting Points\n\n**If you're feeling confident:** Choose an advanced challenge with\nmultiple data layers. **If you are a beginner, choose something more\nmanageable that helps you understand the basics**\n\n**If you have a different idea:** Propose your own question! Just make\nsure:\n\n-   You can access the spatial data\n\n-   You can perform at least 2 spatial operations\n\n### Your Analysis\n\n**Your Task:**\n\n1.  **Find and load additional data**\n    -   Document your data source\n    -   Check and standardize the CRS\n    -   Provide basic summary statistics\n\n```{r}\n# Load your additional dataset\n```\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n\n-   What dataset did you choose and why?\n\n-   \n\n-   What is the data source and date?\n\n-   \n\n-   How many features does it contain?\n\n-   \n\n-   What CRS is it in? Did you need to transform it?\n\n-   \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2.  **Pose a research question**\n\nWrite a clear research statement that your analysis will answer.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n-   \"Do vulnerable tracts have adequate public transit access to\n    hospitals?\"\n\n-   \"Are EMS stations appropriately located near vulnerable\n    populations?\"\n\n-   \"Do areas with low vehicle access have worse hospital access?\"\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n3.  **Conduct spatial analysis**\n\nUse at least TWO spatial operations to answer your research question.\n\n**Required operations (choose 2+):**\n\n-   Buffers\n\n-   Spatial joins\n\n-   Spatial filtering with predicates\n\n-   Distance calculations\n\n-   Intersections or unions\n\n-   Point-in-polygon aggregation\n\n**Your Task:**\n\n```{r}\n# Your spatial analysis\n```\n\n**Analysis requirements:**\n\n-
