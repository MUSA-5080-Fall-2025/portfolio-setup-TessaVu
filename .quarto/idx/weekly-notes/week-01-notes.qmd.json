A little goes a long way, commit little changes constantly to avoid large commits that take time to look through and debug.\n  - *Applying technical skills to public issues*, which not only means making details as transparent as possible, but also utilizing accessible and open-source software and other tools that many communities and individuals can use and pull from.\n- **Technical Skills**\n  - Syntax and semantic familiarity with R and Markdown\n  - Keeping track of folder paths for organization.\n  - Consistent notation in script files for documentation.\n  - Crafting relevant and readable variable names for external audiences.\n  - Repitition is the mother of learning for programming languages.\n\n## CODING TECHNIQUES\n- \"group_by()\" and \"summarize()\" functions go hand-in-hand to essentially isolate specific pockets of data within the tables and derive certain calculations from them, like averages, medians, standard deviations, etc.\n- \"select()\" and \"filter()\" functions are for columns and rows, respectively, and are inverted in ArcGIS.\n- \"mutate()\" function is used to create new variables, specifically new columns or modifying existing columns in data frames.\n- Quarto combines multiple languages and makes it readable, so familiarity with using Markdown to format websites and communicate visualization and data is important.
