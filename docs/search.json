    "text": "This portfolio documents my learning journey in Public Policy Analytics (MUSA 5080).\n\n\nAdvanced spatial analysis and data science for urban planning and public policy.\n\n\n\n\nWeekly Notes: Learning reflections and key concepts.\nLabs: Completed assignments and analyses.\nFinal Project: Capstone modeling challenge.\n\n\n\n\nAnalytically driven and adaptable with 2 years of research and 4 years of professional GIS experience primarily in vector data. Applied and academic knowledge in surveying project sites, remote sensing, drone navigation, and photogrammetry methods. Experience with Java, Python, and R for OOP, data science, geocomputation, spatial analysis, web-mapping, app development, and visualization.\nAs a result of my education and work history I have a deep interest in urban prototyping and instrumentation to record cities, deploying IoT sensors to collect real-time data for research in urban science, transportation, and environmental issues. Extending from that curiosity underlies a steadfast belief in everyone’s rights to privacy and security in a world that constantly wants to monitor, police, and sell our data coercively and unconsensually—this fundamental foundation takes precedence to deploying any sensing device.\nThis course will allow me to refine my existing technical skillset and challenge me to apply them to urban and social predicaments that plague us—cities, municipalities, communities, the environment, people. What’s important to me is that this class focuses on not becoming lost in the STEM aesthetics at the cost of humanitarian rights, educating future graduates about the damage that predictive analytics has wrought, especially in policing and how many tools wielded can disproportionately affect minoritized identities and peripheral communities.\n\n\n\n\nEmail: tessavu@upenn.edu\nGitHub: @TessaVu"

Is it to establish the “docs” folder when doing it locally, because there was an error where the folder didn’t exist when trying to publish the portfolio just from the website.\nNeed more practice with understanding local and GitHub file structures and how they relate to one another as well as R functions. There’s a basic understanding with coding syntax and semantics, but what complexities occur in the background with data storage and the abstractness of it?"

    "text": "Connections to Policy\n\nThere’s a great potential for using predictive analytics to provide useful information and turn it into public-serving action, but they’re also tools that can be purposefully or unintentionally misused to exacerbate biases and existing social stratification, like predictive analytics for crime and policing.\nData science is useful for cleaning raw data, which will inevitably be collected in massive numbers due to the inherently large nature of cities and people."
